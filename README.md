1.  Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design? 

The Client, The Gaming Room wants to develop a web-based game that serves multiple platforms based on thier current game, Draw it or Lose it.Their software requires Game and team names must be unique to allow users to check whether a name is in use when choosing a team name, and this application will render images from a large library of stock drawing as clue. 

2.  What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I think I did particularly well in explaining the business constraints. I detailed the contraints with explanation and provided a solution. 
<br />

3.  What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

The process of working through the design document helped me to be awared of the requirements, constraint and domain when I was developing the code. 
<br />

4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would like to revise the platform evaluation because I am not familiar with some of the operating system and would love to learn more about it to provide an extensive analysis. 
<br />

5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The main needs for the user would be security and storage management. In my software design document, I have explained my recommendations in detail regards to these matter. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing because it aim to provide outstanding experience while the user using our application. Also, it is essential to indentify the business constraints in the design document so the client can understand the issue that they may face and consider the options to improve efficency. 
<br />

6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

For this project, the UML diagram shows the attribution, methods, relationships and multiplicity of each class; it helped me to visualize the way how the game system is designed before coding. I utilizing the UML diagrams like as a check list while implementing the program to ensure everything was in place. A programmer should write sophisticated comprehensive codes but it can be done without deliberation, evaluation and analyzation. Therefore, it is important to start a design document includes requirements, constraints, evaluation, recommendation and domain model - UML diagram, psuedocode, or flowchart before implementing the application.
