# TheGamingRoom
1.  Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design? 

&emsp;&emsp; The Client, The Gaming Room wants to develop a web-based game that serves multiple platforms based on thier current game, Draw it or <br /> 
&emsp;&emsp; Lose it.Their software requires Game and team names must be unique to allow users to check whether a name is in use when choosing a  <br /> 
&emsp;&emsp; team name, and this application will render images from a large library of stock drawing as clue. 

2.  What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

&emsp;&emsp;I think I did particularly well in explaining the business constraints. I detailed the contraints with explanation and provided a solution. 
<br />

3.  What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

&emsp;&emsp;The process of working through the design document helped me to be awared of the requirements, constraint and domain when I was  <br /> 
&emsp;&emsp;developing the code. 
<br />

4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

&emsp;&emsp;I would like to revise the platform evaluation because I am not familiar with some of the operating system and would love to learn more <br /> 
&emsp;&emsp;about it to provide an extensive analysis. 
<br />

5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

&emsp;&emsp;The main needs for the user would be security and storage management. In my software design document, I have explained my <br /> 
&emsp;&emsp;recommendations in detail regards to these matter. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing because it aim to provide  <br /> 
&emsp;&emsp;outstanding experience while the user using our application. Also, it is essential to indentify the business constraints in the design  <br /> 
&emsp;&emsp;document so the client can understand the issue that they may face and consider the options to improve efficency. 
<br />

6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

&emsp;&emsp;For this project, the UML diagram shows the attribution, methods, relationships and multiplicity of each class; it helped me to visualize  <br /> 
&emsp;&emsp;the way how the game system is designed before coding. I utilizing the UML diagrams like as a check list while implementing the program <br /> 
&emsp;&emsp;to ensure everything was in place. A programmer should write sophisticated comprehensive codes but it can be done without deliberation,  <br /> 
&emsp;&emsp;evaluation and analyzation. Therefore, it is important to start a design document includes requirements, constraints, domain model <br /> 
&emsp;&emsp;such as UML diagram, psuedocode, or flowchart, evaluation and recommendation before implementing the application.
