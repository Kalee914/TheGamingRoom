1.  Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design? 

&emsp;&emsp; The Client, The Gaming Room wants to develop a web-based game that serves multiple platforms based on thier current game, Draw it or <br /> 
&emsp;&emsp; Lose it.Their software requires Game and team names must be unique to allow users to check whether a name is in use when choosing a  <br />

&emsp;&emsp;I think I did particularly well in explaining the business constraints. I detailed the contraints with explanation and provided a solution.

3.  What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

&emsp;&emsp;The process of working through the design document helped me to be awared of the requirements, constraint and domain when I was  <br /> 
&emsp;&emsp;developing the code. 
<br />

4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

&emsp;&emsp;about it to provide an extensive analysis.
